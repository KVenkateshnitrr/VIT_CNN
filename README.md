# VIT_CNN
This project was developed using ViT and CNN to identify plant illnesses. The XAI model identifies and interprets the plant illness. 
The ViT model, a key component of our project, is responsible for extracting the features from the plant images. This crucial step provides the necessary data for further analysis and identification of plant illnesses, keeping you well-informed about the process. The custom CNN model extracts the features from the plant leaf image dataset.
The extracted features are used for feature concatenation. This concatenation helps to optimize plant illness identification.
The DL models are block models; we have to incorporate the XAI models to interpret this model.
